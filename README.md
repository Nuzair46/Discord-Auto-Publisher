# Discord Auto Publisher

Automatic Discord Announcement Publisher.

* This is a monkey script. A better closed source bot is available on my [website](https://rednek46.me/works/).


### Setup

* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Input Bot token in `token.txt`
* python bot.py
* Can be deployed on heroku.

### improvments

* Add a database if on heroku or json if on a vps to save the announcement channel rather than using a queue.
